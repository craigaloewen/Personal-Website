      <h2>The Design</h2>
      <p class="pagetext"> Spot Me is an Open Source application that uses a Microsoft Kinect to determine the position of your skeleton, analyze it, and then give you personalized advice on the way to improve your form when doing an exercise. If you’re new to weights it will coach you on how to do the exercise properly, and if you’re experienced it will show you where your form can be improved. Spot Me is made in mind for people who want to critique their form in their living room, and especially useful for any handicapped individual, as many gyms are not handicapped accessible. Spot Me is provided under the Apache License 2.0. </br></br>
        This project is developed by Craig Loewen with help from Microsoft products, Nick Gillian’s Gesture Recognition Toolkit and designed by Patrick Piechnick.

        <h2>Check That Your Form Is Correct With Personalized Advice</h2> 
        <p class="pagetext">Spot me’s goal is to be used during a workout. With that in mind, it has a built in Set Feature. This allows you to complete your exercise, and then go back and analyze your skeletal positions for each rep, including the advice from Spot Me on how to improve your form. Or if you want to experiment and see what is good or bad form, use the continuous mode for a continuous analysis of your skeleton.</p>

      <h2>Spot Me Learns Your Form</h2>
      <p class="pagetext">First, Spot Me uses the Kinect’s API to read in the Skeleton Data from the user. It loads, and modifies this data into a usable format. The data is fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM), with a linear kernel. This was chosen as with the high degree of dimensions, the data is generally linearly separable. The SVM classifies the skeleton’s position into what kind of form it is, and outputs the appropriate message. Through continuing use of the application, which adds more training data, the SVM will build a better picture of the user’s form, and output more accurate and reliable data. </p>

    <h2>Coming Soon to Xbox</h2>
    <p class="pagetext">Microsoft has stated they will soon release the skeleton streaming capabilities to the Universal Windows Platform. Spot Me can then be migrated over to a UWP application, and can be used on any Kinect enabled Xbox. The user interface and program structure is already set up for the port. Sign up with your email address at the top of this page to be notified when Spot Me comes to Xbox! </br> 
     Spot Me already has a full application design, which you can see below, thanks to the graphic designer Patrick Piechnick! To learn more about him click here. </p>
