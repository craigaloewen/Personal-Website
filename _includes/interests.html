                <h3>TRAVELLING</h3> 
                <p>I love to travel and have lived in many different places. Most recently, I lived in Konstanz
                    Germany where I was able to speak in both German and French. I enjoy learning about new places and
                    cultures. </p>

                <h3>LEARNING</h3>
                <p> I work on multiple pet projects in my spare time. In 2014 I built my own working quadcopter
                        from scratch, programmed it, and learned how to fly it. I've built a Hydrogen fuel cell powered RC
                        car, and a robot that can launch jelly beans into your mouth from across the room. </p>

                <h3>TRAINING AND ADVENTURING</h3>
                <p> Another way that I push myself is through physical training. I aim to be
                    able to bench press 300 pounds by the end of 2018. 'For me life is continuously being hungry. The
                    meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.'
